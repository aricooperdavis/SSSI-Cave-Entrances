# SSSI Cave Entrances
This project illustrates how many of cave and mine entrances (and other karst features such as sinks, resurgences, and digs) can be found on Special Sites of Scientific Interest in Great Britain.

> **Note**: the results of this analysis are only as reliable as the source data used. Whilst some work has been done to correct obvious mistakes in the source data, it cannot be assumed to be completely accurate.
